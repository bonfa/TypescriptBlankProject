# Typescript Project Skeleton
This is the skeleton of an `npm` project with a simple failing test. 
This can be used as a starting point for katas or even real projects.

It contains two testing libraries, `jest` and `typemock`.  


## Pre-requirements
A few steps are required in order to be able to run the test:
* Install **npm**
* Open a console in the root of the project
* run `npm i` in the console
